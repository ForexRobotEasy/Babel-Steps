2. Calculate the trend strength for buying and selling by comparing the current price to the Fibonacci levels.
3. Check if the trend strength exceeds the specified level for position opening and open a buy or sell position accordingly.
4. Check the Bollinger Bands indicator for oversold or overbought market conditions and generate buy or sell signals.
5. Check the Stochastic indicator for increasing or decreasing the position and adjust the position accordingly.
6. Generate a trailing stop level when the market moves in the desired direction.
7. Set a target for position closure upon reaching a specified level and close the position if the target level is reached.

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the Expert Advisor is removed from the chart or the platform is closed. In this function, any necessary cleanup is performed.

### Product Description

The Babel Steps Expert Advisor is a powerful Forex trading tool that combines trend analysis, Fibonacci levels, Bollinger Bands, and Stochastic indicators to generate accurate trading signals. It is designed to take advantage of market trends and identify profitable entry and exit points.

By analyzing multiple timeframes using Fibonacci levels, the Expert Advisor identifies potential trend reversals and determines the strength of the trend. It then uses the Bollinger Bands indicator to identify oversold or overbought market conditions, providing additional confirmation for trading signals. The Stochastic indicator is utilized to fine-tune the position by determining whether to increase or decrease the position size.

The Expert Advisor also offers risk management features such as a trailing stop, which allows traders to protect their profits as the market moves in their favor. Additionally, a target level for position closure can be set, ensuring that profits are locked in when the market reaches a specified level.
